# BiciMAD
This is part of the work I have done for my master thesis group. The project is focused on the analysis and visualization 
of data from BiciMAD, a public bike sharing transportation system in Madrid.

My contribution is mainly made up of the following:

- ETL process for accidents in Madrid from 2014 to 2018
- Visualization of accidents data
- Merging data from multiple tables to carry out exploratory data analysis
- Developing statistical models to analyze variable relationships and impact
